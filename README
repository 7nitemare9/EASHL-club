EASHL club webapp and site

This is a deprecated version of my eashl club site  
If your interested in a club site check out my [new version](https://github.com/aostlund/Meteor-EASHL-club-site).  
Unless of course your interested in a ruby-on-rails version then you have to fix this up yourself.   
Most things works as expected but EA has changed how their internal API works so you have to figure that out (by checking the new version or sending me a question).
