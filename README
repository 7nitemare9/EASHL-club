EASHL club webapp and site

Reads in team, match and player statistics from Easports "internal" API

Also updates current team-members and checks their online status against xbox-live.

All this is currently automated with cronjobs working by curl-get and is going to change over time to a more secure way.

Check out our live site at http://www.bombers-hockey.com

Instructions how to use this will come at later time or when parts are extracted out to self-contained services.

But feel free to use this as is and contribute to making this the best EASHL club app/site there is.
